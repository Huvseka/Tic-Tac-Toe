# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic-Tac-Toe is a two-player game where players take turns marking "X" or "O" on a 3x3 grid. The goal is to align three of your symbols in a row, column, or diagonal to win.
But in this code we initialize one player mode and with a rainy background themeto make the game looks attractive and more encouraging.
